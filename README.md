# Gross_Pitaevskii_PEF2

This repository contains implementations of some numerical algorithms to find the ground state solution of 
the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, describing an approximate behaviour of Bose-Einstein condensates.
In particular, Backward Euler Finite Differences (BEFD) and Backward Euler Pseudo Spectral (BESP) have been used.
